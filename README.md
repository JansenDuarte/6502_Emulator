Future Plans

Trying to emulate the MOS Technology 6502, the 8 bit processor inside my old Atari Lynx.

Setting up a simple ROM read for programs and games to be emulated with this processor.

Later on I'll emulate the full 'Mikey' & 'Suzie' architecture. Setting up communication
patterns similar to the real one.


Special Thanks
